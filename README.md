# Welcome to My Data Analysis Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I’m Kathir, Mater's degree Gradute in Economics and a data analyst with a passion for turning raw data into meaningful insights. This repository showcases a collection of projects that highlight my expertise in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

## About This Portfolio

In this portfolio, you’ll find a range of projects demonstrating my skills in various aspects of data analysis:

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Projects where I’ve tackled messy datasets, performed data wrangling, and prepared data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth explorations to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applications of statistical methods to derive insights and support data-driven decision-making.
- **Data Visualization:** Creation of compelling visualizations to effectively communicate findings and support decision-making.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building and evaluating predictive models to forecast trends and outcomes.

Each project in this page includes detailed descriptions, code link, and where applicable, interactive visualizations or dashboards. You can explore the code, analysis, and visualizations to see the methodologies and techniques used to tackle real-world data challenges.

## Key Technologies

I use a variety of tools and technologies in my data analysis work, including:

- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, BeautifulSoup
- **R Programming**: ggplot2, dplyr, caret, ivreg
- **SQL:** Data extraction and manipulation
- **Excel:** Advanced formulas, pivot tables, and data visualization
- **Tableau/Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and data visualizations

  
## Project 1: Big Mart Sales Prediction
![](assets/sales-forecasting-metrics-1024x768.jpg)


This project aims to build a machine learning model to forecast sales for various products across different Big Mart outlets. The retail industry often faces challenges in predicting sales due to the vast array of products and the diverse characteristics of stores. Accurate sales predictions can help businesses manage inventory, optimize supply chain processes, and improve customer satisfaction by ensuring product availability.

This project utilizes a dataset provided by Kaggle, which includes information about products, such as item weight, visibility, type, and maximum retail price (MRP), as well as details about the outlets, like their size, location, and establishment year. The primary goal is to predict the `[Item_Outlet_Sales]`, which is the sales of the products at the respective outlets.
