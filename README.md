# Welcome to My Data Analysis Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my Portfolio! I’m Kathir, Mater's degree Gradute in Economics and a Data analyst with a passion for turning raw data into meaningful insights. This Page showcases a collection of projects that highlight my expertise in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

## About This Portfolio

In this Portfolio, you’ll find a range of projects demonstrating my skills in various aspects of data analysis:

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Projects where I’ve tackled messy datasets, performed data wrangling, and prepared data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth explorations to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applications of statistical methods to derive insights and support data-driven decision-making.
- **Data Visualization:** Creation of compelling visualizations to effectively communicate findings and support decision-making.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building and evaluating predictive models to forecast trends and outcomes.

Each project in this page includes detailed descriptions, code link, and where applicable, interactive visualizations or dashboards. You can explore the code, analysis, and visualizations to see the methodologies and techniques used to tackle real-world data challenges.

## Key Technologies

I use a variety of tools and technologies in my data analysis work, including:

- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, BeautifulSoup
- **R Programming**: ggplot2, dplyr, caret, ivreg
- **SQL:** Data extraction and manipulation
- **Excel:** Advanced formulas, pivot tables, and data visualization
- **Tableau/Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and data visualizations

  
## Project 1: Big Mart Sales Prediction 
![](assets/sales-forecasting-metrics-1024x768.jpg)

## Project Overview
Developed a machine learning model to predict sales for various products across Big Mart outlets, using XGBoost Regressor to address challenges in the retail industry such as inventory management and supply chain optimization.

## Dataset
Utilized Kaggle's Big Mart Sales dataset, which includes product and outlet details such as item weight, visibility, type, MRP, outlet size, location, and establishment year.

## Key Steps
- **Data Collection & Processing:** Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted EDA using Pandas and Seaborn to check for missing values, and understand numerical and categorical features.
- **Data Pre-Processing:** Handled missing values by filling in the mean for `Item_Weight` and the mode for `Outlet_Size`. Applied label encoding to convert categorical variables to numerical values.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Trained an XGBoost Regressor model, achieving an R-squared value of 0.64 on training data and 0.59 on testing data.

## Outcome
The model provided reasonable sales predictions with some room for improvement, demonstrating its potential for enhancing inventory management and customer satisfaction.
